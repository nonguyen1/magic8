# magic8
This is a magic 8 ball program that I wrote to learn/experiment with Javascript.

What I hope to get out of this project:
- Gain more experience with Javascript
- Deploy this application into a html webpage.
- Make an athestetically pleasing application.

File List:
index.html -- The playground html file for hosting the javascript file.
phrases -- List of magic 8 ball strings.
